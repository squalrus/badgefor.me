# Badge For Me

A satirical project about corporate attendance culture and the absurdity of presenteeism in modern workplaces.

## Project Overview

BadgeFor.Me is a conceptual art/comedy website that parodies corporate attendance expectations. It presents a fictional service that collects your work badge, drives it to your office, and scans it on your behalf—enabling you to work remotely while appearing to be in the office.

**This is satire. No actual badge scanning services are provided. No fraud is committed. Only jokes are made.**

## Website Features

- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching tagline and value proposition
- **How It Works**: 4-step process explaining the fictional service
- **Pricing Tiers**: Three plan options (Basic, Full, Elite)
- **Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of the system components
- **Technology Section**: 7 AI systems that power the service (all satirical)
- **FAQ**: 12 questions addressing common concerns about the service
- **Expandable FAQ**: Click questions to reveal/hide answers
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
